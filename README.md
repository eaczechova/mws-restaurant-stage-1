#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

In the Stage One of the **Restaurant Reviews** project, I have incrementally converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. I took a static design that lacks accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. Also, I have converted this to a Progressive Web Application by caching some assets for offline use.

## Installation and Deployment

1. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000` to see how the application looks like.
